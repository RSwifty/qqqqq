## <center> It's finally here... </center>

Correct. I decided to make this divine revelation a public thing. My private Queens bot becomes public as of now, unfortunately for some of y'all I'm not open-sourcing it but publishing the executable. If you think you're one of my very close friends in this Sneaker community, feel free to ask for a license key in my [DMs](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=998654195912925184).

No-one ever published a Queens bot before so here you go fellas. 
I've been constantly working on this project for a very long time, all features are listed down bellow.

P.S: More detailed documentation/videos will be added later.
#### Example

This bot is connected to my extremely fast monitor which isn't public and prolly won't ever be.
 
#### Features
- CLI Interface
- Beautiful logging output
- Mutliple modules (Discord cloud, Requests, Browser Mode)
- Task threading to multiple CPU cores
- 10/10 Error handling
- much, much more.
